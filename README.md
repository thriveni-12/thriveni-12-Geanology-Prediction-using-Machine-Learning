📘 About the Project
Genealogy Prediction Using Machine Learning and CNNs is an AI-based facial analysis system that applies machine learning techniques — specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — to predict which facial features a child has inherited from parents or grandparents.

🧠 What It Does
This project leverages deep learning, a subset of machine learning, to:

Extract complex facial features using CNN architectures like VGG16

Compare facial traits between a child and family members

Predict hereditary patterns based on facial similarity scores

Provide an AI-based prediction of inherited features

🤖 Role of Machine Learning
Utilizes pre-trained CNN models to learn deep facial representations

Implements pattern recognition and classification algorithms to identify genetic resemblance

Enhances accuracy over traditional manual or rule-based image comparisons

Demonstrates how ML can infer biological traits through visual data

💡 Key Highlights
Built using VGG16 CNN architecture

Combines image preprocessing, feature extraction, and ML-based prediction

Showcases a real-world use of machine learning in genealogy and facial analysis

Outputs structured results showing which parent or ancestor contributed which traits

🔍 Why This Project?
Offers an innovative ML-based solution for ancestry and resemblance analysis

Makes genealogy more accessible and engaging through AI

Suitable for educational, research, or consumer AI applications
